# 🏥 Hospital Readmission Forecasting

**Author:** J. Casey Brookshier  
**Last Updated:** July 2025  

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end, reproducible machine learning pipeline to predict hospital readmission risk using publicly available CMS quality metrics, healthcare-associated infection data, and socioeconomic deprivation indicators (Area Deprivation Index, ADI).

The goal is to help healthcare administrators and policy analysts identify facilities at higher risk of readmission penalties and target interventions more effectively.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a predictive model for hospital-level readmission performance by:

- Cleaning and standardizing multiple CMS datasets
- Integrating clinical quality, infection control, and socioeconomic risk factors
- Engineering a composite readmission risk score
- Comparing linear and tree-based regression models
- Producing deployable model artifacts

---

## 📊 Data Sources

All data are publicly available:

- **CMS Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (FY2025)**  
  Hospital-level readmission metrics by clinical condition

- **Healthcare-Associated Infections – Hospital**  
  Facility-level infection control performance indicators

- **Area Deprivation Index (ADI)**  
  ZIP-code–level socioeconomic disadvantage metrics

> Raw data files are stored in `/data`.  
> The analytic dataset is generated programmatically.
